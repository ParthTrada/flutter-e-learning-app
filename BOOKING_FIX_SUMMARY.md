# 🔧 Booking Schedule Refresh Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The booking was successful (payment confirmed), but the scheduled meetings were not showing up in the schedule tab because the schedule data was not being refreshed after successful booking.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Payment Bottom Sheet Fix**
**File**: `lib/src/features/book_expert/presentation/schedule_for_book/payment_bottom_sheet.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `schedule_riverpod.dart`
- Modified `_handlePayment()` function to refresh schedule data immediately after successful payment
- Added: `await ref.read(scheduleProvider.notifier).refreshMeetings();`

### 2. **Booking Confirmation Fix**
**File**: `lib/src/features/book_expert/presentation/schedule_for_book/confirm_booking_bottom_sheet/confirm_and_pay_bottom_sheet.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `schedule_riverpod.dart`
- Modified "Done" button to refresh schedule data before closing
- Added: `await ref.read(scheduleProvider.notifier).refreshMeetings();`

### 3. **Tab Navigation Fix**
**File**: `lib/src/features/parents/riverpod/parentsScreen_provider.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `schedule_riverpod.dart`
- Modified `onSelectedIndex()` to accept `WidgetRef` parameter
- Added automatic schedule refresh when navigating to schedule tab (index 1)

**File**: `lib/src/features/parents/presentation/parents_screen.dart`

**Changes**:
- Updated `onTap` callback to pass `ref` parameter to `onSelectedIndex()`

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

1. **After Payment Confirmation**: Schedule data is refreshed immediately
2. **After Booking Confirmation**: Schedule data is refreshed when "Done" is pressed
3. **When Navigating to Schedule Tab**: Schedule data is refreshed automatically
4. **Manual Refresh**: Users can still pull-to-refresh on the schedule screen

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Book a Session**:
   - Select an expert
   - Fill in session details
   - Complete payment
   - Confirm booking

2. **Check Schedule Tab**:
   - Navigate to schedule tab
   - The booked session should now appear
   - If not visible immediately, pull down to refresh

3. **Verify Data**:
   - Check that the session details are correct
   - Verify the expert information is displayed
   - Confirm the session time and date

## 🔄 **Refresh Triggers**

The schedule will now refresh in these scenarios:
- ✅ After successful payment confirmation
- ✅ After booking confirmation ("Done" button)
- ✅ When navigating to schedule tab
- ✅ Manual pull-to-refresh gesture
- ✅ App restart/refresh

## 📱 **Expected Behavior**

After booking a session:
1. Payment is processed successfully
2. Booking confirmation shows
3. User taps "Done"
4. Schedule tab automatically refreshes
5. New booking appears in schedule list
6. User can see their scheduled session

The fix ensures that users will always see their latest bookings without needing to manually refresh or restart the app.
